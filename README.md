# SpeedRun
SpeedRun is an Android fitness game. <br/>

"Spheres" are randomly generated in public areas near the player's current location. Players must physically go to the spheres' location to collect them within a certain amount of time. The game progressively gets harder as the time allowed for sphere collection is shortened and the distance between spheres are increased. <br/>

The game connects to an Android smartwatch or Pebble and relays to it the directions of the closest sphere so the user can play without continuously looking at their phone. Exercise time, heart rate, and number of steps are collected through the smartwatch and phone so that players can record their exercise metrics.<br/>

Won 2nd place at U of T Hacks 2015.<br/>
Made with Steven Jia, Xin Ming Fan, and Yu Chen Hou.
