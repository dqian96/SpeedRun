# SpeedRun
SpeedRun is an Android fitness game. Spheres are randomly generated in public areas near the player's current location. Players must go to the spheres to collect them within a certain time. The game progressively gets harder as the time allowed for sphere collection is shortened and the distance between spheres are increased. The game connects to an Android smartwatch or Pebble to relay the directions of the closest sphere so the user can play without continuously looking at their phone. Time, heart rate, and number of steps are also collected to record the player's exercise metrics.<br />
